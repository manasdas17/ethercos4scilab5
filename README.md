## Welcome to the ethercos4scilab533 wiki!
This is my personal repository to store and make available my efforts to migrate Ethercos to Scilab 5.

[Ethercos](http://www.etherlab.org/en/ethercos/index.php) was created by the guys of [IgH Engineering](http://www.etherlab.org/en/who.php) (many thanks!). It is a module running under [Scicos](http://www.scicos.org/)/[Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/en) enabling scicoslab/xcos to use real hardware in the loop. The hardware is any number of EtherCAT devices, under the control of an EtherCAT master, also from IgH. 

The latest Ethercos release was in 2009, for Scicos 4.3. Scicos moved to version 4.4.1. In addition there has been a fork of Scicos, which is [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/en). SCiclab seems to be much more alive and kicking. Hence the desire to migrate Ethercos to Scilab5.

A guy from IgH has been working on this, but seems not to find enough time to arrive at something he believes is worthy of publishing. I did have some time left, and thought it would be a good learning project to get to know both Ethercos and Scilab/xcos. And I am willing to show stuff in a state that is far from complete (be warned!).

Cheers,
Len Remmerswaal
