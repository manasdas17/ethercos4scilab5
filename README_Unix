II - INSTALL THE EtherCos TOOLBOX FOR SCILAB/SCICOS
===================================================

  The requirements for installing EtherCos from source code are the following:

    a - Scilab.

      The new version of EtherCos only runs with Scilab 4.1.2 and Scilab_GTK-4.1.2 and Scicoslab-4.3.
      Your Scilab can be both a stable version (source, binary file).
      Get it from www.scilab.org

    b - Operating System
      
      EtherCos has to be executed under Linux (until now only X86 is supported).
      A running Kernel with HRT-Timer activated and the Preempt-RT patch included is neccessary.
      
      Tested Plattforms:
	- Debian Etch (i386)
	- Debian Lenny (i386)

    c - EtherCAT-Master

      EtherCos needs a running EtherCAT-Master Stack (Version >=1.5). Please install from www.etherlab.org

    d - C Compiler.

      The source version of EtherCos contains several .c files (see the section:
      "VI - TOOLBOX COMPOSITION", below) that must be compiled as a shared
      library.

      The most widely used compiler is GCC.
	
    e - Perl

      EtherCos will need a perl installation. That should be no problem on most systems.
      Furthermore you need the XML::LibXML and IO::File modules.
   
    f - TcL/Tk
      EtherCos will need a local TcL/Tk installation
 
  The 3 steps that follow must be performed when you only have to install the
  toolbox (i.e. one time only). If you already have installed the toolbox, skip
  to the next section: "III - LOAD THE EtherCos TOOLBOX FOR SCILAB/SCICOS".

    1 - Unpack the file ethercos-0.0.2-rxxx-src.tar.gz.


      The file can be unpacked in a directory of your own choice, provided that
      the path to this directory does not contain any spaces.


      The unpacked files are stored in a directory called ethercos-0.0.1-rxxx-src.
      From now on, the path to the ethercos-0.0.2-rxxx-src directory will be referred to as
      <PATH>.

    2 - Build EtherCos.

      Open the Scilab prompt and type the following command:

                        exec <PATH>/builder.sce;

      This will compile EtherCos on your machine. It is also possible to use the Makefile:
			cd <PATH>; make


********************************************************************************

III - LOAD THE EtherCos TOOLBOX FOR SCILAB/SCICOS
=================================================

  Open the Scilab prompt and type the following command:

                        exec <PATH>/loader.sce;

  This will load the toolbox into Scilab. You must type this command in every
  Scilab session that you want to use the toolbox.

 Note that, as the final user, you may want EtherCos to be loaded automatically. To
  do this just put the above command in your ~/.Scilab/(VERSION)/.scilab startup file for
  automatic loading.

  An additional caveat: if somewhere in your scilab session you run the clear
  command, you will have to reload the toolbox. To avoid that, you can add the
  command predef('all') in your ~/.Scilab/(VERSION)/.scilab file after your
  exec <PATH>/loader.sce command.

  As an example, below is the sequence you could do on your own machine for
  automatic loading:

    1 - open ~/.Scilab/(VERSION)/.scilab file with your favorite text editor.

    2 - Add the following line at the end of ~/.Scilab/(VERSION)/.scilab:

                        exec <PATH>/loader.sce;

    3 - Add the following line after your exec command:

                        predef('all');

    4 - save the ~/.Scilab/(VERSION)/.scilab file.


  That's it! Every time you enter scilab it already loads EtherCos-Scicos 
  and even if you run the clear command you won't have to reload the toolbox 
  anymore.

********************************************************************************
IV - REMARKS
============
EtherLAB-Scicos will be renamed to EtherCos because of naming convention on the website www.etherlab.org.



********************************************************************************
V - DOCUMENTATION
=================

  Detailed HTML help documentation, written in English language is provided for
  each Scilab function and Scicos block in the toolbox. Every help page is
  enriched with many examples which illustrate the usage of the corresponding
  Scilab function or Scicos block.

********************************************************************************
VI - TOOLBOX COMPOSITION
========================

  The root directory contains 7 sub-directories:

   1 - etc/
	contains the starter script ethercos_toolbox.start. This file is executed from loader.sce
   2 - includes
	some c/c++-header files
   3 - macros
	macros for compiling and loading the toolbox
   4 - modules
	modules-directory. At startup the loader.sce in each subdirectory is excuted. 
   5 - src
	some c/c++ files which can be used in all modules
   6 - template_for_module
	can be used as template for a new module. copy the directory your_name to modules and rename the directory.

  and 4 files:

    1 - builder.sce

      The main builder script. Build also all modules.

    2 - loader.sce

      The main loader script.

    3 - README_Unix

      This file. Notes about toolbox description and installation.

    4 - license.txt

      The text of the GNU General Public License Version 2, under which the
      toolbox is distributed.
